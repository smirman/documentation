This guide walks through setting up federating Prometheus metrics to S3 storage.

> ToDo - Add Authorization in front of Thanos APIs


## Pre-Prequsites

1. A ROSA cluster

1. clone this repo down locally

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/rh-mobb/documentation
    cd docs/rosa/federated-metrics
    ```

## AWS Preperation

1. Create IAM user

    ```bash
    aws iam create-user --user-name thanos-receiver | jq
    ```


1. Update the `s3-policy.json` file with the ARN from the output.

1. Create an S3 storage account

    ```bash
    aws s3 mb s3://my-thanos-metrics
    ```

1. Grant access for the thanos user to the s3 bucket

aws s3api put-bucket-policy --bucket my-thanos-metrics \
  --policy file://s3-policy.json

1. Get the account key and secret and update in `thanos-store-credentials.yaml`

```bash
aws iam create-access-key --user-name thanos-receiver | jq .
```

1. Create the Thanos Store Credentials Secret

```bash
oc new-project thanos-receiver
oc apply -f thanos-store-credentials.yaml
```

## Enabling User Workload Monitoring

> See [docs](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.7/monitoring/enabling-monitoring-for-user-defined-projects.html) for more indepth details.

1. Check the if user workload is enabled (`enabledUserWorkload: true`)

    ```bash
    oc -n openshift-monitoring get configmap cluster-monitoring-config  \
      -o json | jq -r '.data."config.yaml"'
    ```

1. If not, enable User Workload Monitoring by doing one of the following

    **If the `data.config.yaml` is not `{}` you should edit it and add the `enableUserWorkload: true` line manually.**

    ```bash
    oc -n openshift-monitoring edit configmap cluster-monitoring-config
    ```

    **Otherwise if its `{}` then you can run the following command safely.**

    ```bash
    oc patch configmap cluster-monitoring-config -n openshift-monitoring \
       -p='{"data":{"config.yaml": "enableUserWorkload: true\n"}}'
    ```

1. Check that the User workload monitoring is starting up

    ```bash
    oc -n openshift-user-workload-monitoring get pods
    ```

## Deploy Thanos Store Gateway

<!--

> we should be able to skip this because its in the yaml now.

1. Create a service account for the Thanos Store Gateway

    ```bash
    oc -n thanos-receiver create serviceaccount thanos-store-gateway
    oc -n thanos-receiver adm policy add-scc-to-user anyuid -z thanos-store-gateway
    ```
-->

1. Deploy the thanos store

    ```bash
    oc apply -n thanos-receiver -f thanos-store.yaml
    ```

1. Deploy Thanos Receiver

    > Note we should be securing this via [OIDC / Bearer Tokens](https://www.openshift.com/blog/federated-prometheus-with-thanos-receive)

    ```bash
    oc -n thanos-receiver apply -f thanos-receive.yaml
    ```

1. Append remoteWrite settings to the cluster-monitoring config to forward cluster metrics to Thanos.

    ```bash
    oc -n openshift-monitoring edit configmaps cluster-monitoring-config
    ```

    ```yaml
      data:
        config.yaml: |
          ...
          prometheusK8s:
          ...
            remoteWrite:
              - url: "http://thanos-receive.thanos-receiver.svc.cluster.local:9091/api/v1/receive"
    ```

1. Append remoteWrite settings to the user-workload-monitoring config to forward user workload metrics to Thanos.

    **Check if the User Workload Config Map exists:**

    ```bash
    oc -n openshift-user-workload-monitoring get \
      configmaps user-workload-monitoring-config
    ```

    **If the config doesn't exist run:**

    ```bash
    oc apply -f user-workload-monitoring-config.yaml
    ```

    **Otherwise update it with the following:**

    ```bash
    oc -n openshift-user-workload-monitoring edit \
      configmaps user-workload-monitoring-config
    ```

    ```yaml
      data:
        config.yaml: |
          ...
          prometheus:
          ...
            remoteWrite:
              - url: "http://thanos-receive.thanos-receiver.svc.cluster.local:9091/api/v1/receive"
    ```


## Deploy Thanos Queryier

1. Deploy the thanos querier

    ```bash
    oc apply -n thanos-receiver -f thanos-querier.yaml
    ```

## Deploy Grafana

1. create the grafana operator in the thanos-receiver namespace

    ```bash
    oc apply -n thanos-receiver -f thanos-grafana-operator.yaml
    ```

1. create grafana instance and datasource for thanos

    > Change the password to something less default.

    ```bash
    oc -n thanos-receiver apply -f thanos-grafana.yaml
    ```

1. load up cluster metrics dashboards

    > Note: these were generated by the [generate-dashboards.sh](generate-dashboards.sh) script.

    ```bash
    oc -n thanos-receiver apply -f dashboards.yaml
    ```

1. get the Route URL for Grafana (remember its https) and login using username `root` and the password you updated to (or the default of `secret`).

    ```bash
    oc -n thanos-receiver get route grafana-route
    ```

1. Once logged in go to **Dashboards->Manage** and expand the **thanos-receiver** group and you should see the cluster metrics dashboards.  Click on the **Use Method / Cluster** Dashboard and you should see metrics.  \o/.
